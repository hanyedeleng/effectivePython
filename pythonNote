You can also figure out the version of Python you're using at runtime by
inspecting values in the sys built-in module.

Python 3 is constantly getting new features and improvements that will never be
added to Python 2.

Things to remember:
1. There are two major versions of Python still in active use: Python 2 and
Python 3
2. There are multiple popular runtimes for Python: CPython, Jython, IronPython,
PyPy, etc.
3. Be sure that the command-line for running Python on your system is the
version you expect it to be.
4. Prefer Python 3 for your next project because that is the primary focus of
the Python community.
